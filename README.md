# O.S.-First-fit-Algorithm
This algorithm applies the First-fit technique to assign processes to memory locations.

********* How The Algorithm Works *********
1- there ara 5 memory locations in this project. The user specifies the size of each memory location as desired.
2- There are 4 processes pending to be assigned to memory based on their size. The user specifies the size of each processes well.
3- After setting the size of the processes and memory locations, the user hits "Assign Values" in order for the values to be saved.
4- Finally, the user hits "Apply first fit" button to run the algorithm.

********* System Output *********
The system displays the assigned memory location for each process. Alongside the memory locations' size after assigning processes to them. In case there is a process that cannot be assigned to a location due to its size, the system informs the user that the process will have to wait.
